## Introduction

Quantum Minigolf reinvents the traditional game of minigolf by incorporating quantum mechanics principles, featuring a golf ball with quantum behavior distinct from classical physics. Developed through sophisticated Python programming, this project serves as a simulation to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of quantum phenomena. It exemplifies the application of complex quantum concepts in a familiar setting, providing an engaging and educational tool for exploring the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

## Customization

> NOTE: This is a **work in progress** meaning it is not yet complete and may not provide the most accurate information.

If you want to customize styling, speed, etc, feel free to change the parameters in the `style.json` file. For information on each of these parameters, see the table below:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `scale` | The size of the screen (scale value) - Note that it multiplies the values under `defaults` |
| `resolution` | The resolution of the game itself, the higher the value, the slower the game |
| `duration` | The amount of frames until it checks if the ball is in the goal |
| `colors` | The colors of the game (Obstacle is typical RGB values, whereas the ballHeatmap RGB values can only be either 1 or 0 as they are the multiplier values) |
| `obstaclePresets` | Presets/obstacles you can initially choose from |
| `defaults` | The default values for the game (Recommended not to change) |
